        <section class="Personal Statement">
            <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>In anticipation of studying for a master’s in software engineering at the University of Tartu I am eager
                to apply strong critical thinking, technical expertise, and passion for technology in a professional
                role alongside my studies to make an impact as part of a team and grow as an individual.</p>
            <p>My experience includes software engineering roles, focused on web and mobile application development; and
                data analytics roles, focused on tag management and user analysis. Proficiency in Java, Typescript, C#,
                and Python frameworks, and experience in agile development environments in industry allows adaptability
                to differing project demands.</p>
            <p>A purposeful approach and a strong work ethic, astute attention to detail and resilience under pressure
                characterise my professional persona. Talented at grasping new concepts quickly, and with a confidence
                in my skillset that positions me to succeed in diverse roles.</p>
